1. a. What is Morse code?

      Morse code is a character encoding scheme used in telecommunication that encodes text characters as standardized sequences of two different signal durations called dots and dashes (or dits and dahs).

      What is called Morse code today is actually somewhat different from what was originally developed by Vail and Morse. The Modern International Morse code, or continental code, was created by Friedrich Clemens Gerke in 1848 and initially used for telegraphy between Hamburg and Cuxhaven in Germany. Gerke changed nearly half of the alphabet and all of the numerals, providing the foundation for the modern form of the code. After some minor changes, International Morse Code was standardized at the International Telegraphy Congress in 1865 in Paris and was later made the standard by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). Morse's original code specification, largely limited to use in the United States and Canada, became known as American Morse code or railroad code.

    b. Who developed Morse code?

    Samuel Morse and Alfred Vail collaborated in the invention of Morse code. There is some dispute over the role of each in the invention.
    Although the development of Morse code is often attributed to Samuel Morse himself, some scholars believe that Vail actually invented the system of dots and dashes.  

    Some claim that Morse originally devised a cipher code similar to that used in existing semaphore line telegraphs, by which words were assigned three- or four-digit numbers and entered into a codebook. The sending operator converted words to these number groups and the receiving operator converted them back to words using this codebook.

    The code of dots and dashes used today may in fact have been developed by Vail. According to the Quarter Century Wireless Association, while developing the hardware for the telegraph system, it was actually Vail who came up with the idea to use dots and dashes to represent different letters of the alphabet. The code could be converted into electrical impulses and sent over telegraph wires. He then set about assigning combinations of dots and dashes to each letter based upon their frequency of use (i.e., the simplest codes for the most frequently used letters, hence, e is a single dot).
