# __How the Embedded System Works__

# __Design Challenges__

## __Throughput__
_May need to handle lot of data in short period of time_

Cubesats typically operate in low Earth orbits, which means that they are travelling extremely fast with respect to the ground (~7 km/s). Consequently, there are only short communication windows with the ground station when the satellite can transmit and receive data. This means that the satellite must be able to handle large amounts of data in short periods of time. Cubesats are also often equipped with sensors which generate large volumes of data. A common application of cubesats is for imaging of the Earth's surface. Limited bandwidth may be available for transmission of images from cubesats to the ground. Hence, it may be necessary to perform image processing with the onboard microprocessor in order to reduce the data sufficiently for transmission. 

## __Response__ 
_Reacting to events quickly_

Responding to information received from various sensors and acting on it. For example, it may enter an uncontrolled spin and need to act quickly on the gyroscope data to correct the spin as quickly as possible. It must also be able to respond immediately to commands received from the ground. For example, it may need to perform a collision avoidance maneuver if orbital debris or another satellite going to intersect it's orbit. 

## __Testability__
_Special equipment required to test the embedded software._

Testing the satellite fully under space-like conditions is challenging. _A test environment to validate their
CubeSatâ€™s de-tumbling control system and hardware. The test environment required a Helmholtz
cage and spherical air bearing. The Helmholtz cage provides an adjustable magnetic field to
simulate low earth orbit; the spherical air bearing simulates the friction free environment the
CubeSat will experience in space. In conjunction, the two components create an adjustable
system that simulates a satellite in low earth orbit._


## __Debugability__
_Without a screen or keyboard, finding out what software is doing wrong is troublesome._


## __Reliability__
Once it is launched, there is no option to physically interact with the system to address potential problems. If there is a malfunction, the system must be able to recover on its own. 


## __Memory Space__


## __Program Installation and Upgrade__
Usually have a ground mock of the system to thoroughly test any software updates before upload to the satellite.


## __Power Consumption__
The small size of cubesats is their main advantage along with their low production cost due to the ability to manufacture at scale. However, the limited size has an impact on the available power resources. In space, solar power is widely used to power satellites. The limited real estate available to deploy solar panels on cubesats results in limited power resources. Also, the limited size restricts the available space for power storage solutions. Cubesats must be equipped with storage and low power modes when to allow for operation when the satellite is passing through the Earth's shadow. 

## __Security__
Be able to prevent malicious uploads...especially for military satellites. Maintain secure communications. 


## __Cost__
Cubesats main selling point is their low cost compared to more traditional satellites. The cost per lb to lauch mass into a low earth orbit is ..., hence, minimizing the mass of the satellite is important. Generally, the aim is to maximize the available mass for the system payload. Hence, The systems must also be radiation hardened to allow the electronics to operate
