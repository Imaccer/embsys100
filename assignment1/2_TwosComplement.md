# __2. Two's Complement__
Question: Why use twoâ€™s complement to represent negative numbers?

Answer: Two's complement is useful for simplifying the implementation of arithmetic on computer hardware. Two's complement is used to represent negative numbers because it allows the addition of operands without a subtraction circuit or a circuit that detects the sign of the operands. An addition circuit can perform subtraction by taking the two's complement of a number which only requires an additional cycle (or its own adder circuit).

Subtraction is equivalent to the addition of a negative number. 

For example, consider subtracting 20 from 31. Normally this would be expressed as: 31-20. However, we can instead write 31 + (-20).

The first step is to express -20 in two's complement:

    20 in binary: 00010100 (20)
    Invert:       11101011 
    Plus 1:       11101100 (-20)

Hence, the two's complement representation of (-20) is: 11101100

We can now perform the subtraction operation (or more accurately, addition):

     111111000  Carry row           
      00011111 (31)  
    + 11101100 (-20)  
    ____________
      00001011 (11)
    ____________  

Note, since we are operating on two 8-bit numbers, the result is limited to be an 8-bit number so the final carry over is not used.
